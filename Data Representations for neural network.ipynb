That's a total of 106,168,320 values, if the dtype of tensor was float32, then each value will be stored in 32 bits, so the tensor will represent the size of 405 MB.Heavy! videos we encounter in real life are much lighter, becasue they are not stored in float32.They arec ompresssed by a large factor(MPEG format) "
