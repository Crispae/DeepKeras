    "As you can see, the training loss decrease with every epoch, and the training accuracy increases with every epoch, and the training accurcy increases with every epoch. That's what we expect hen runnung gradient optimization- the quantity you're trying to minimize should be less with every iteration. But that isn't case case for validation loss  and accuracy, they seen to peek at fourth epcoh. The model that perform better on the training data isn't necessarliy a model that will fo better on data it has has nver seenbefore.In precise term what you are seeing is `overfitting`: after the second epoch, we are overoptimizing on hte training data, and you end up learning representation that are specific to the training data and don't generalize to data outside of the training set.  \n",

    "In this case to prevent overfitting you should stop training data after three epcohs.There are bunch of other techniques to mitigate overfitting."
